## About Me

Hello! I'm Mubashir G Mohammed.

I'm a driven MSc Data Science student with a passion for machine learning and a background in mechanical engineering and entrepreneurship, on a mission to use data and ML techniques to solve complex business problems and drive revenue growth.

I believe in continuous learning and professional development to stay on top of the latest industry trends and technologies. This commitment, combined with my solution-oriented mindset, resilience in the face of challenges, and ability to think outside the box, drives me to find innovative solutions to complex problems.

When I'm not crunching numbers or coding, I enjoy going to the gym and playing different sports.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on!
